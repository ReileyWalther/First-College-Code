	Analysis:
		Inputs:		Month, Year, Total collected
		Outputs:	Month, Year, Total collected, Product sales, County sales tax, State sales tax, Total sales tax, Total sales tax all in a neat display
		Formulas:	Product sales = Total collected/1.06
				Total sales tax = Total collected - Product sales
				County sales tax = Total sales tax * 1/3
				State sales tax = Total sales tax * 2/3
		Constraints:	The year cannot be after the current year
				If the year is valid, the month cannot be after the current month
				Total amount collected must be > 0
		Assumptions:	User will enter, in this order when prompted, the month, year and the total amount collected

	Design:	
		1. Get the input from the user
		       Get the month
		       Get the year
		       Get the total amount collected
		2. Process data collected and calculate
		       Find product sales
		       formula: Product sales	 = Total collected/1.06
		       Find Total sales tax
		       formula: Total sales tax  = Total collected - Product sales
		       Find County sales tax
		       formula: County sales tax = Total sales tax * 1/3
		       Find State sales tax
		       formula: State sales tax  = Total sales tax * 2/3
		3. Display the output of calculated values
		       Display Month and year followed by a line
		       Display Total amount collected, product sales, County sales tax, State sales tax and Total sales tax
